    <h1>Hi, Bonjour, 你好 I'm BloxdMaster, or Blxm for short.</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I'm a Canadian - Chinese teenager based in Surrey, BC. In grade 3, I was introduced to the world of coding. I wanted to learn to code before, but didn't know where to start. Blockly, a alternitive to Scratch was the programming language I was introduced, but it didn't make sense. I always pondered how machines, computers, etc work with "blocks" of code. After clicking random buttons, I eventualy found a button that converts the blocks into JavaScript code so like any other Grade 3, I was curious what JavaScript was, so I eventually Googled "Learn JavaScript". </p>
